                    I remember it was something like that.

                            Obsidian is a type of igneous rock, a natural volcanic glass that is formed when lava erupted from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth.
                            Since obsidian is glassy, it is brittle, but on the other hand, it is easy to work with and has a sharp cross section, so it is thought to have been a highly valued stone during the Stone Age, when it was used as blades and arrowheads. "

                    My wife read the article in the newspaper and told me,
                    "Wow, that's amazing, obsidian was being transported by
                    boat from Kōzu-shima Island to Izu and Boso a long time ago."
                    I read the article she gave me.
                    I don't remember the details,
                    but I think it said that tens of thousands of years ago,
                    obsidian was transported from Kōzu-shima to all parts of Japan by boat.
                    At the time, I took it with a grain of salt <a class="f-note" href="#t1"><span>[Note 1]</span></a>,
                    but for some reason, it just stuck in my mind.

                <p class="pb10">
                    When I saw
                    <a class="f-note" href="#p1">Google Maps shows a map of Japan 20,000 years ago, amazing use... <span>[1]</span></a>
                    I thought that perhaps the obsidian from Kōzu-shima was transported without
                    the use of boat during a time when the island's sea level was lower.

                <p class="pb10">
                    To clear my mind of lingering doubts, I started researching,
                    beginning with "Kōzu-shima" and "obsidian". And so my adventure began.

                    When I searched for "Kōzu-shima obsidian",

                    the strings 37,500 years ago or 38,000 years ago <a class="f-note" href="#t2"><span>[Note 2]</span></a>.
                    The keyword 38,000 years ago suggests that obsidian excavated from ruins dating back
                    about 38,000 years ago came from Kōzu-shima,
                    and has apparently been excavated from ruins all over Japan.

                    When I clicked on it, instead of jumping to a web page, a PDF was downloaded.
                    In a feature article in Iwanami Shoten's "Science" by
                    <a class="hover-link2" href="https://www.meiji.ac.jp/cols/english/personals/members/IKEYA_Nobuyuki.html" target="_blank">
                    Nobuyuki Ikeya</a> of the Meiji University Obsidian Research Center,
                    he detailed his theory, based on scientific evidence, that obsidian was transported to the Izu Peninsula by boat 38,000 years ago.
                </p>
                <p class="pb10">
                    According to
                    <a class="f-note" href="#p2">Ikeya <span>[2]</span></a>,
                    38,000 years ago was a relatively warm time even in the late Paleolithic period,
                    and the sea level was about 80m lower than it is today. However, even if it is 80 meters lower,
                    there is a gap between Kōzu-shima and Izu Peninsula.
                    It has been pointed out that the water depth reaches 800 meters in some places,
                    and obsidian had to be transported by boat.

                <p class="pb20">
                    I actuallyopened Google Maps with reference to <a class="f-note" href="#p1">You can use Google Maps to see a map of Japan from 20,000 years ago,
                    an amazing way to use it... <span>[1]</span></a>.
                    Google Maps shows the depth of the ocean using gradations to some extent.
                    All I could tell from the map was whether the area looked deep or shallow.
                    Even looking at Google Maps, I couldn't imagine what it was like when the sea level was 80m lower than it is today.
                    I also looked it up in "Google Earth Pro",  but got the same result.
                    However, I learned that "Google Earth Pro" can display contour lines if the appropriate data is imported.
                    If we know the above sea level in the past,
                    we may be able to recreate the coastline at that time by plotting it with contour lines  <a class="f-note" href="#t4"><span>[Note 4]</span></a>.

                        Taking all of this into consideration, it would appear that 38,000 years ago,
                        voyagers traveled to Japan via [Korea - Tsushima Island- Kyushu] route - ④,
                        and at roughly the same time,
                        they were making round trip voyages between the Izu Peninsula and Kōzu-shima.
                        It seems reasonable to assume that navigators who were able to cross the 40km distance
                        between South Korea and Tsushima would have been able to make a round-trip voyage
                        between Izu Peninsula and Kōzu-shima.

                        I believe it was extremely valuable at the time.
                        I imagine that people skilled in navigation came to the Japanese archipelago
                        in search of such materials.

                    we can see that above sea level from 20,000 to 18,000 years ago
                    (light green band) was 120m lower than today.

                    At first, there didn't seem to be much difference

                    but I noticed that if it was 140m lower, the Tsugaru Channel would become connected to the land.
                    Kaifu wrote that  <a class="f-note" href="#p5">the Tsugaru Channel was crossed 25,000 years ago <span>[5]</span></a> .
                    As shown in <a href="#f21">Fig. 2-1</a> (Above sea level from 42,000 years ago to the present) ,
                    the avobe sea level 25,000 years ago was 106m lower than now,
                    so even taking into account the 20m width, it is estimated to be between 106m and 126m.
                    According to
                    <a class="f-note" href="#p5">Kaifu's theory <span>[5]</span></a> ,
                    boats would have been used to cross the Tsugaru Strait.
                    However, it is thought that the distance was such that the opposite shore could be seen just ahead.

                    From here on, I would like to proceed under the assumption
                    that avobe sea level was 140m lower 20,000 years ago.
                    When above sea level was 140m lower, we can see that the Sea of ​​Japan became a huge lake.
                    At that time, there was a route from the continent to Japan via [Sakhalin - Hokkaido - Honshu],
                    and an easy route to Kyushu was also open from Korea or further south.

                    it is explained that Humans did not need boats to cross over to the Japanese archipelago,
                    but instead traveled overland.
                    Indeed, 20,000 years ago they could have walked across.

                    <q cite="https://ameblo.jp/20190831-0925/entry-12794495171.html">
                    Why was there no obsidian from Kōzu-shima at the Tanamukaihara Site from 20,000 years ago?
                    (personal working hypothesis)
                    It's not a difference in location (Ashitaka foothills vs Sagamihara),
                    but a difference in time (20,000 years ago vs 34,000 years ago).
                    20,000 years ago was the coldest period of the last glacial period,
                    and the average temperature was 6 to 7 degrees lower than today.
                    As a result, the risk of shipwrecks increased,
                    and shuttle voyages to Kōzu-shima to obtain obsidian were abandoned (scaled down). </q>
                    I found this to be very interesting.
                    However, this is an event that took place over several thousand years,
                    and I think it would be difficult to explain the 20,000-year gap.

                    Before the age of Homo sapiens, there were many different species of early humans and
                    archaic humans in Asia.
                    However, in this day and age, we are the only ones left, Homo sapiens. We are a mysterious existence. </q>
                    Then, as to the purpose of the experimental voyage, he states,
                    <q cite=https://news.yahoo.co.jp/feature/1066/>
                    Because early humans and archaic humans could not cross the vast oceans.
                    Only Homo sapiens have made serious advances into the ocean.
                    So what abilities did they have that enabled them to cross the ocean?
                    To find out, we need to actually build a boat
                    using as much of the technology of the time as possible and try to cross it. </q>
                    He considers that the first humans to cross the Japanese archipelago were <strong>Homo sapiens</strong>.

                    While researching the humans who came to the Japanese archipelago,
                    I came across an article in National Geographic called

                    The article states that the conventional wisdom—that Homo sapiens are the last human species on Earth
                    and that they evolved without intermingling with other human species
                    when they spread out of Africa—has been significantly challenged.
                    The results of DNA analysis of molars, jawbones, and little fingers
                    excavated at various sites are seriously shaking up the conventional image of Homo sapiens.

                    It shows that everyone today has Neanderthal genetic information and

                <p class="pb10">
                     This was about 1000 years before the transportation of obsidian from Kōzu-shima stopped.
                    It is likely that humans who came from the [Taiwan - Ryukyu - Kyushu] route encountered humans
                    who came from the [Korea - Tsushima - Kyushu] route somewhere.

                    In the first scenario, the humans who arrived later were
                    unable to learn about the obsidian from Kōzu-shima that the earlier humans knew about,
                    and so transportation declined.

                <p class="pb20">
                    In the second scenario, as earlier and later humans interbred,
                    various information was shared. In the process,
                    if the demand for obsidian from Kōzu-shima decreased, transportation would have declined.

                    humans came to the archipelago via the Hokkaido route 25,000 years ago.
                    Then, during the last ice age (20,000 to 18,000 years ago),
                    it became possible for various human groups to migrate
                    from the continent to the Japanese archipelago via multiple routes.

                <p class="pb10">
                    Considering that Denisovan DNA has been passed down to us today,

                    who came to the Japanese archipelago has also been inherited through generations to the present day.

                    <p>
                        The article mentioned that the type of stone was obsidian, but at the time,
                        I imagined heavy rectangular stones like marble or granite, quarried from stone pits.
                        Why would they go out of their way to transport such heavy stones from Kozushima to Honshu?
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb5">
                        Even if there was a need for that, it would have required a considerably large boat to carry them.
                        I thought there was no way such large boats could have existed in the Stone Age,
                        which was far earlier than the Jomon period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, evidence continued to emerge, showing that obsidian was being transported around 38,000 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb10">
                        Most of the articles I looked into also included explanations about obsidian.
                        Since I had been imagining large, heavy stones, I initially skimmed over the explanations about obsidian.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb5">
                        It wasn't until I went back and re-read those pages that
                        I noticed they explained obsidian was used to make arrowheads and blades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I had made a significant misunderstanding. </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb5">
                        To begin with, how could stones have been <strong>extracted</strong> during the Stone Age?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, I decided to research more about obsidian.
                        What I found was that, unlike marble or granite,
                        obsidian is not a stone that can be quarried in large quantities from stone pits.
                        Since only a very small amount of obsidian could be obtained through mining,
                        it was feasible to transport it using the boats of that time.

                        I don't have detailed knowledge about (ship, boat).
                        I think "ship" refers to something large, and "boat" refers to something small. That's about it.
                        What did ships look like 38,000 years ago?

                        It is certain that there have been various tectonic movements between 38,000 years ago and the present.
                        Therefore, the question arises as to whether the Japan of that time
                        can be replaced with the Japan of today.
                        I did some research on websites that write about the origins of the Japanese archipelago,
                        but there are various theories, ranging from 100,000 years ago to 20,000 years ago,
                        and I was unable to narrow it down.
                        Please note that the diagram presented here is based on the present-day Japanese archipelago,
                        with contour lines added.

                        Currently, there is a lake on Sumatra that is 100 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide.
                        This lake is the world's largest caldera lake, created by the Toba volcano, which erupted 74,000 years ago.
                        This volcanic eruption caused tremendous damage to the Earth,

                        This major eruption is thought to have had a major impact on Homo sapiens,

                        as well as on human species who were already living in Europe and Asia.
                        Isn't it possible to think that each human species started migrating in search of a place that was a little better to live in?
